* Flying from SEA (Seattle, WA) to AVP (Scranton, PA) will require a *layover* in ORD (Chicago, IL)
* Flying from [ANC (Anchorage, AK) to ADK (Adak Island, AK) will have a *stopover* in CDB (Cold Bay, AK)](https://onemileatatime.com/alaska-airlines-adak-cold-bay/). These passengers will not deplane in Cold Bay. Stopover duration cannot be predicted due to variants in passenger and cargo loads.
